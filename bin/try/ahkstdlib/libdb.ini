If you read often from ini file, then this might for you.

Description = Defines how controls should be automatically positioned relative to the new dimensions of a window when resized.`n`nThe position and size of controls within an AutoHotkey Gui are fixed at default. Even if the Gui changes its size, the controls position and size does not change automatically. The solution is to update their positions or sizes by hand with the GuiSize event. For this task, the Anchor function does the neccessary repositioning and update.

Abstract = A solution for Manipulating AHK's Arrays v2
Description = There have been requests for real arrays in ahk for a long time, and people have come up with several not to shabby solutions by putting the array in one var. (e.g. AHKA, SimpleArray) But for several (good) reasons, some don't want to use those, and instead choose to use AHK's psuedo arrays.`n`nPsuedo arrays are OK, but they're limited. There are some things that psuedo-arrays just can't do, like passing an array as a func param. Other things are just a big pain and give people headaches, like inserting or removing an element in an array. (not overwriting and clearing) What I present here is a way to alleviate these headaches.

Abstract = Dock AHK windows
Description = Using dock module you can glue windows to an AHK window.`n`nDocked windows are called Clients and the window that keeps their position relative to itself is called the Host. Once Clients are connected to the Host, this group of windows will behave like single window - moving, sizing, focusing, hiding and other OS events will be handled by the module so that the “composite window” behaves like the single window.`n`nThis module is version of Dock module that supports only AHK hosts (hence A in the name). Unlike Dock module, it doesn’t uses system hook to monitor windows changes.
